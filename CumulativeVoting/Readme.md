# A Solidity contract to implement the mechanism of cumulative voting

## Cumulative Voting

Cumulative voting (also referred to as accumulation voting or multi-voting) is a multiple-winner cardinal voting method intended to promote more proportional representation than winner-take-all elections. A cumulative voting election permits voters in an election for more than one seat to put more than one vote on a preferred candidate. When voters in the minority concentrate their votes in this way, it increases their chances of obtaining representation in a legislative body.

## Mechanism

This smart contract implements a cumulative voting mechanism. The owner of the contract has the power to call for nominations for candidates and open the elections, following which citizens can register as candidates and/or voters and then cast their votes. Each registered voter begins with 1 vote which can be changed by the owner. The owner is also the only one with the option of stopping the registrations. Once the votes have been cast, the owner is in-charge of calculating the total votes won by each candidate and displaying the results of the election. The various functions, structures and variables used to write the contract are as given below. 

### Contract - Cumulative_voting

- Struct - <i>candidate</i>
  - string variable <i>name</i> to store the candidate's name
  - address variable <i>unid</i> to store the candidates unique ID
  - uint256 variable <i>votecount</i> to store the candidate's vote count
  - boolean variable <i>ifAuthC</i> to check if the candidacy is authorised or not
- Struct - <i>voter</i>
  - string variable <i>name</i> to store the candidate's name
  - address variable <i>unid</i> to store the candidates unique ID
  - bool variable <i>ifVoted</i> to check if the voter has voted already or not
  - bool variable <i>ifAuthV</i> to check if the user is authorised to vote or not
- address variable <i>Owner</i> Owner of the contract
- Modifier - <i>isOwner</i>: Modifier to limit the use of certain functions to only the owner
- uint256 variable <i>numberOfSeats</i> to store the number of winners
- Function - <i>getnumberOfSeats</i>
- candidate[] <i>candidateList</i> - List of candidates
- voter[] <i>voterList</i> - List of voters
- <i>authVoters</i> - mapping of authorised voters
- bool variable <i>openToVote</i> 
- bool variable <i>nominationsBeingAccepted</i>
- bool variable <i>resultDeclared</i>
- <i>constructor</i> - To initialize variables 
- Function - <i>getCandidatelist</i> - Fetches the candidate list
- Function - <i>signUpVoter</i> - Registers an authorised voter to vote in the elections
- Function - <i>signUpCandidate</i> - Registers an authorised candidate to stand in the elections
- Function - <i>authoriseVoters</i> - Used by only the owner to authorise voters
- Function - <i>authoriseCandidates</i> - Used by only the owner to authorise candidates
- Function - <i>closeNominations</i> - Used by only the owner to close nominations
- Function - <i>openVoting</i> - Used by only the owner to open voting
- Function - <i>closeVoting</i> - Used by only the owner to close voting
- Function - <i>castVote</i> - Used by an authorised voter to cast their vote
- string[] <i>winners</i>
- uint256 variable <i>winnerVoteCount</i> - Stores the voteCount of the winner
- Function - <i>compileResult</i> - Counts the number of votes received by each candidate and decides the winner of the election
- Function - <i>viewResult</i> - Returns the name of the winner and the number of votes, if the result has been declared

## Versatility of the code

The code written can be aptly modified and made suitable to cater to the need of any individual situation simply by:
- changing the number of seats using the getNumberOfSeats
- changing the authorization process for voters and/or candidates

These 2 features allow the code to be used in various situations apart from those immediately guessable.

## Drawbacks

- In case the last two candidates get the same number of votes and there is only one seat vacant, then according to this smart contract, the person with the lower index number in the array, i.e, the candidate who has registered earlier will be declared as winner. So to fix such tie breakers we might have to use some external conditions.

- While Authorising candidates and voters, here we have assumed that the voters and candidates are authorised to begin with, but in a real-world scenario we would have to use some form of identification such as a Voter ID to authorise a person casting vote or competing in the election.

- In our code the owner of the contract has the power to close nominations, open voting, close voting and declare the result. The <b>Owner</b> can manually perform these functions at the moment when they wish to do so. This flaw of manually doing such things can be automated using block timestamp and providing with the time of registration, voting and result declaration in the code initially.

## Opportunities for improvement:

- This version of the code does not support voters with different weightages. It treats each and every voter as the same and gives all of them the same number of votes. Often in cumulative voting we could see circumstances where each voters could be having a different power or different weight for their vote being required. We can add a 'uint256 weight' under voter and will have to modify the cast castVote function a little in order to implement it.
- This system doesn't allow the delegation of votes and in newer versions this feature could be added.
